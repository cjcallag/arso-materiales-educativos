# Relaciones Multiples

- Los actores suelen estar involucrados en más de un tipo de relación
- Los diferentes vínculos a menudo empujan y arrastran a los actores en diferentes direcciones (los vínculos pueden ser interrelacionados entre sí)
- Cuantas más redes podamos mapear, más clara es la imagen que tenemos de la red en general.
- Cuatro enfoques para trabajar con relaciones múltiples:
  - Plegado: Bimodal a monomodo ✅
  - Apilar: Agregar relaciones a una red
  - Extracción: Aislando nodos y enlaces en base a atributos
